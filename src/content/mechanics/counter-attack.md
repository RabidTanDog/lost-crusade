      reason: "When the low level troops attack yours, your counter attack will immediately kill them.",
    },

note: "Your army should contain only dreadnaughts and your heroes should use dreadnaught health and defensive buffing gear. Since so many heroes with counter attack also have damage reduction skills (ie. Indomitable Defense), your army can take absolutely grueling amounts of damage before succumbing. You should also consider using a Dodge Wall if only to eat a few splash attacks from heroes like Voldus."

When your troops are attacked, they will immediately counter attack with a regular attack.
