note: 'To send a "dodge wall", you should send your march with at least one troop of each type, of each level (ie. 45 troops) to help dodge enemy attacks. If you use one of these heroes, you should always use a "dodge wall" strategy â€” even against line-ups it is weak against.'

When an army is attacking, the action order is:

1. [todo: image] Does it hit?
1. [todo: image] Damage done!

If an attack misses, **all troops** of that type miss.

[todo: image]

This means that with high dodge, enemies will eventually miss.

[todo: image]

Padding your strong army with lots of single units makes it more likely that an enemy will miss with their strongest attacks! This gives your army plenty of extra time to deal as much damage they can.
